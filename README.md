blurring-the-lines
==================

Narrowing the gap between the mobile web and native applications.
These are the demos I showed on 28 Aug 2014 at AKQA Berlin for http://techinsight.io

Installing:
Prerequisites: working Node, compass.

(Node on OSX: homebrew. http://brew.sh - install this then type "brew node" in a terminal window.)
(Compass on OSX: sudo "gem install compass" in a terminal window.)

git clone the repo
"npm install -g grunt grunt-cli" in a terminal window if you haven't already done this.
Change directory to the root of where you checked this repo out.
"npm install" in a terminal window
"grunt build" to build everything into "/examples"
"grunt server" to run a connect server. Do this then point your browser at http://localhost:9000 for demos.
